            us. These terms tell you who we are, how we will provide products to
            you, how you or we may change or end the contract, what to do if
            there is a problem, and other important information. If you think

            this, by any of the methods listed in clause 2.1.

            dealing. These terms also constitute the entire agreement between us
            in relation to your purchase. You acknowledge that you have not
            relied on any statement, promise, representation, assurance, or
            warranty made or given by or on behalf of us, which is not set out
            in these terms, and that you shall have no claim for innocent or

            collect them from us at any time during our normal working hours,
            which are Monday to Friday 8:00 am to 5:00 pm and Saturday 8:00 am
            to 12:00 pm, and you must do so within 10 days of us notifying you
            that the products are ready for collection.

              <li>
                (a) if the products are goods, we will contact you with an
                estimated delivery date, which is normally within 30 days from
                the day after we accept your order. If the goods are not
                available to be delivered to you within this period, we will
                contact you to notify you. Depending on the nature and size of
                the goods, we will either deliver the goods ourselves or via a
                third-party courier;
              </li>
              <li>
                (b) if the products are services, the estimated completion date
                for the services will be notified to you during the order
                process;
              </li>

            or collection of the product in accordance with clause 7.3, we will
            contact you for further instructions and may charge you for storage
            costs and any further delivery costs. If, despite our reasonable
            efforts, we are unable to contact you or rearrange delivery or

            good reason for this), we may charge you additional costs incurred
            by us as a result. If, despite our reasonable efforts, we are unable

            control, then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you
            know, and we will take steps to minimize the effect of the delay.
            Provided we do this, we will not be liable for delays caused by the
            event. But if there is a risk of substantial delay, you may contact
            us to end the contract and receive a refund for any products you
            have paid for but not received.

              cancel your order for any of the products or reject products that

              order for some of those products (not all of them), unless

            anything wrong with it, how we are performing, when you decide to
            end the contract and whether you are a consumer customer or business
            customer:

              your money back), please see clause 17 if you are a consumer and

              (c) If you are a consumer and have just changed your mind about
              the product, see clause 14.3. You may be able to get a refund if
              you are within the cooling-off period, but this may be subject to
              deductions and you will have to pay the costs of return of any
              goods; or

            Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right

            can still end the contract before it is completed, but you may have
            to pay us compensation. A contract for goods is completed when the
            product is delivered. A contract for services is completed when we
            have finished providing the services and you have paid for them. If

              during the sales process.

              However, we are not responsible for the cost of repairing any
              pre-existing faults or damage to your property that we discover
              while providing the services.

            23. OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS
          </h3>
          <ol className=" space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>23.1 </strong> We may transfer our rights and obligations
              under these terms to another organisation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>23.2 </strong>
              You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these
              terms to another person if we agree to this in writing to a person
              who has acquired the product or, where the product is services,
              any item or property in respect of which we have provided the
              services.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>23.3 </strong>
              This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have
              any rights to enforce any of its terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>23.4 </strong>
              Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any
              court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful,
              the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>23.5 </strong>
              If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
              required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps
              against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will
              not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not
              prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example,
              if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to
              provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment
              at a later date.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>23.6 </strong>
              These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal
              proceedings in respect of the products in the English courts. If
              you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of
              the products in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you
              live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in
              respect of the products in either the Northern Irish or the
              English courts.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>23.7 </strong>
             If you are a business, any dispute or claim arising out of or
              in connection with a contract between us or its subject matter or
              formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be
              governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England
              and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive
              jurisdiction to settle any such dispute or claim.
